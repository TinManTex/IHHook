IHHook changelog 
- just broad sweep changes, otherwise just look at the github commits.

Version r17 - 2022-07-02 (see github for full changes)
FoxString hook.
Bunch of character, buddy, vehicle change hooks.
ihhook_config.lua (next to ihhook/dinput8 dll) - allows some startup settings of ihhook to be set.
FNV Hash logging.
Ghidra scripts to export addresses, func defs, and a refactor and reduction of required steps to get hooks running.

r16 - 2021-08-04
InfCamHook/FOV module moved from IH.
Settings line combined InputText plus Combobox.

r15b - 2021-05-05
some more of the hooked null/stubbed functions shifted to DEBUG build.
Split to a seperate install from Infinite Heaven

r15a - 2021-04-07
Disable StubbedOut hook since it crashes out some users.

r15 - 2021-04-06
Hook and log a couple of stubbed out functions.

r14 - 2021-04-19
Disable mouse input to game when cursor enabled.

Fix: Keys being stuck on when opening menu.

log MH_OK

Hook a bunch of lua functions for error handling (basically just logging)
lua_load
lua_error
lua_pcall
lua_cpcall
re enable lua_atpanic
Gives error logging for all lua files loading by default (including those in fpks), and runtime error logging for anything that's pcalled by the engine.

Fix: font helpmarker font folder text - thanks OldBoss for the report

r13 - 2021-04-12
Style Editor: Font/size selection, copy fonts to MGS_TPP\mod\fonts to add more - thanks IroquoisPliskin, others for the request.

IHMenu improved: Menu items list now descreases in size with window meaning the bottom of the list and setting line wont dissapear when making smaller window.
Window itself no longer adds a scrollbar but help text now has it's own scroll bar. So you don't have to scroll the menu away just to scroll the help text.

Fix: Alt-tabbing or doing anything else that would reset the d3d device would apply the menu InitialText again, which would only fix once you went into a menu to reset the menu list - thanks Yooungi for the report.


r12 IH r248 - 2021-04-08
Support for mgsvtpp JP audio version - thanks everyone for the reports.

r11 IHr247 - 2021-04-05
Hooks_FOV - cribbing from https://github.com/mon/MGSV-TPP-FoV , supported by IH InfCamHook.lua

r10 IHr244 - 2021-03-31
Version jumped IHHook, still have to figure out versioning vs IH required IHHook version vs leeway to release an update of IHHook seperately.
Refactor hook macros for clarity.
Fix: menu close button working from start, doesn't require the IH callback so it can function when it's there as the startup error window.
Fix: Steam version_info.txt check to see if it's the jp language version. Currently it only warns, and does not hook, but that's better than crashing lol.

r7, IHr243 - 2021-03-29
Fix: A grame crash soon after starting - issue likely was user not having vs redist for what IHHook was built against.
Downgraded platform toolset to VS2017/v141 to hit less vsredist issues - thanks fintip for the report and working through test builds with me.

r7, IHr240 - 2021-03-26
Full* lua API hook again. (still a few pesky missing functions).
AddressCSVToMacroHeader.lua
mgstpp-adresses-1.0.15.3.csv - exported from ghidra
To generate function > address macro header, replacing my prior method of manually updating the headers for 100 functions lol.
GetFreeRoamLangIdHook - to override the free roam entry which was hard coded to locations and return empty string for custom.

r7 - 2021-03-24
Target mgstpp.exe 1.0.15.3

IMGUI style editor with save/load.

F3 - togglemenu

Fix: Imgui gamepad support (which was enabled by default, but I wasn't actually using) links xinput, which caused controller - thanks MIKEH2011 for your report and testing.
Fix: SelectCombo was checking menuItems bounds instead of menuSettings, which meant combo selection wouldn't update on keyboard scroll if #combo settings > #menu items.
Fix: Return if exe is mgo (don't know if it was issue)

r6 - 2021-03-12
IPC shakeout.
IHMenu shakeout.

Info and error messages on IHMenu bootup.
OS:CheckVersion to CheckVersionDelta so can tell if IHHook ahead or behind of target exe version.

More lua api tests

r5 - 2021-01-29
IHHMenu IMGUI menu.
Dear IMGUI implementation from RE2FW.
D3D11Hook from RE2FW.
l_GetGamePath
Bit of refactoring.
Attempt to hook various errors and exceptions.

r4 - 2020-01-27
IHHook inited via a thread rather than directly in dllmain, still not 'the way', but better.
After trying a few different types of input it seems like MGSV is using RawInput.
So added a basic rough out of RawInput processing and blocking.

r3 - 2020-01-22
Pipe server

r2 - 2020-01-13
Most of the lua api hooked and get a lua C module (winapi) kinda working.
